What Is A Database?
    1. A collection of data
    2. A method for accessing and manipulating that data

App -> DBMS -> Database
App will communicate to Database using DBMS

[DBMS -> Database] examples :- MySQL, Oracle Database, PostgreSQL, SQLite

SQL :- Structured Query Language
    SQL is the language we use to "talk" to our databases

    Two Takeaways
    1. Once you learn SQL, it's pretty easy to switch to another DB that uses SQL
    2. What makes databases (DBMS) unique are the features they offer, not the language
